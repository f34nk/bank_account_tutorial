# Bank Account Tutorial

As a personal exercise I implemented an Elixir application that displays the transactions on my bank account.

I compiled a little tutorial which you can find on medium.

Please checkout the git branches to see which parts are already implemented.

## Part 1

https://github.com/f34nk/accounting_demo/tree/part_1

This part implements a single package to handle a bank account.
The first feature is `import/2` to import files with account transactions.
Right now, only CSV files from "Deutsche Bank" are supported.

## Roadmap

- [x] Part 1: Import CSV account files from "Deutsche Bank"
- [ ] Calculate basic money operations
- [ ] Render account
